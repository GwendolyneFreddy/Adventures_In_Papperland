ADVENTURES IN PAPPERLAND

This little mod was created couple of years ago as a joke. Author - Charles Bisson.
You can meet and talk to a legendary four - "The Beatles".
Famous musicians by the will of fate found themselves on Faerun.
It's just an unusual meeting and couple of dialogs, no new stuff, spells or quests.

Converted to WeiDU by Badgert from www.aerie-ru.info (iklest@narod.ru), works with any other weidu modes.


Этот маленький модик был создан много лет назад в качестве шутки. Автор - Charles Bisson.
Вы сможете встретиться и пообщаться с легендарным квартетом The Beatles.
Знаменитые музыканты волею судеб оказались на Фаэруне. Просто неожиданная встреча и несколько диалогов.
Никаких новых вещей, заклинаний и квестов.
Преобразование в WeiDU-формат осуществил Badgert from www.aerie-ru.info (iklest@narod.ru).
Мод полностью совместим с любыми другими модами.
